## What is BeaconKit

BeaconKit is a modular framework for building EVM based consensus clients.
The framework offers the most user-friendly way to build and operate an EVM blockchain, while ensuring a functionally identical execution environment to that of the Ethereum Mainnet.


## üöß WARNING: UNDER CONSTRUCTION üöß 


This project is work in progress and subject to frequent changes as we are still working on wiring up the final system. Audits on BeaconKit are still ongoing, and in progress at the moment. We don't recommend using BeaconKit in a production environment yet.



## Supported Execution Clients

Through utilizing the [Ethereum Engine API](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/blob/main/src/engine)
BeaconKit is able to support all 6 major Ethereum execution clients:

- **Geth**: Official Go implementation of the Ethereum protocol.
- **Erigon**: More performant, feature-rich client forked from `go-ethereum`.
- **Nethermind**: .NET based client with full support for Ethereum protocols.
- **Besu**: Enterprise-grade client, Apache 2.0 licensed, written in Java.
- **Reth**: Rust-based client focusing on performance and reliability.
- **Ethereumjs**: Javascript based client managed by the Ethereum Foundation.

## Running a Local Development Network

**Prerequisites:**

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Golang 1.22.0+](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)

Start by opening two terminals side-by-side:

**Terminal 1:**

```bash
# Start the sample BeaconKit Consensus Client:
make start
```

**Terminal 2:**

```bash
# Start an Ethereum Execution Client:
make start-reth # or start-geth start-besu start-erigon start-nethermind start-ethereumjs
```

The account with
`private-key=0xfffdbb37105441e14b0ee6330d855d8504ff39e705c3afa8f859ac9865f99306`
corresponding with `address=0x20f33ce90a13a4b5e7697e3544c3083b8f8a51d4` is
preloaded with the native EVM token.

## Multinode Local Devnet

Please refer to the [Kurtosis README](https://github.com/berachain/beacon-kit/blob/main/kurtosis/README.md) for more information on how to run a multinode local devnet.
